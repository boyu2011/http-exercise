CS615A -- Aspects of System Administration - Spring 2012

HTTP Exercise

Start a NetBSD EC2 instance (ami-820fddeb). On it, install an HTTP server and configure it to listen on port 8080.

(For your convenience, the suitable PKG_PATH for this AMI would be: ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/packages/NetBSD/i386/6.0/All/)

Next, fetch the following two programs:

test.cgi
test2.cgi
Configure your web server such that a user can go to http://<your-instance-name:8080>/test.cgi and sees the message "Hello from group #N", and to http://<your-instance-name:8080>/test2.cgi and sees the message "Group #N says: that was easy".

(For the second part, you will probably find the ktruss(1) useful.)
